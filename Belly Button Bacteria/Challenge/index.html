        <h3>Belly Button Bacteria for Beef Flavor: An Odd Exercise<br><br></h3>
    </div>
  <div class="col-md-8 article-p">
    <p>
      Roza believes that a flavor for beef can be found in belly button bacteria. In order to explore her idea she decided to count the type and frequency of different belly button bacteria in a sample.
       She has provided this information here along with the weekly frequency of belly button washing among the sample participants and counts of bacteria per sample.
       <br><br>I am not sure how she intends to figure out if the bacteria tastes like beef or not. Maybe she has lots of experience licking belly buttons. I don't judge. Everyone has their own thing.

          Its like you have your own zoo of bacteria. I have a zoo membership and there isn't nearly that many animals at my local zoo.<br><br>

           what type of person only washes themselves a couple of times a week?<br><br>

          The graphic above displays the number and type of bacteria in the selcted member of the sample. Larger bubbles indicate larger numbers of the bacteria present. 
          All bacteria are included in this graphic. Select a bubble to display the name of the bacteria. I wouldn't Google them. That is a rabbit hole nobody wants to go down.
